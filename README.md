House Price Prediction:Prediction of the house price based on the details about the various features of the house


## Overview

This analysis of a dataset spanning 2014 and 2015 provides valuable insights for further exploration. We meticulously examined variable characteristics, addressed outliers in the 'price' attribute, and identified potential correlations. Clustering analysis revealed distinct property segments, offering the opportunity for tailored business strategies. These insights pave the way for advanced modelling and more informed real estate decisions, promising a deeper understanding of housing dynamics and enhancing decision-making in the real estate sector.


In the context of modelling, the XGBoost model emerged as a powerful tool for predicting house prices. Its accurate predictions, demonstrated by a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), make it a reli- able choice for real estate transactions. The high R2 score reflects the model's ability to capture a significant portion of the variability in house prices, providing valuable explanatory power. 


Additionally, the versatility of XGBoost mod- els, capable of handling diverse data types and structures, makes them well-suited for real-world scenarios with com- plex and heterogeneous data.
In conclusion, the XGBoost model is recommended for deployment in real estate decision-making processes, leverag- ing its accurate predictions and robust performance across key metrics to support better decision-making in the dy- namic real estate sector.
